## üß± Project Structure (Clean Architecture + .NET Aspire)

### Domain Layer
- Core business entities:
  - **Race**, **Bet**, **Ticket**
- Domain logic and validation rules for betting

### Application Layer
- Implements **CQRS pattern** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Encapsulates use cases:
  - Placing bets
  - Processing races
  - Validating tickets
- Enforces business constraints

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Entity Framework Core** with **PostgreSQL**
- **Redis**:
  - As a distributed **cache**
  - For **Pub/Sub** messaging
- In-memory **wallet simulation** per session

### API Layer (ASP.NET Core Web API)
- REST endpoints to:
  - Place bets
- **SignalR integration** for real-time updates (race results, wallet changes)
- Composed via **.NET Aspire AppHost**

### Background Service (Separate Project)
- Runs independently as a **hosted worker service**
- Responsible for:
  - Generating new race rounds
  - Determining race winners
  - Processing bet outcomes and payouts
  - Publishing results to Redis Pub/Sub and SignalR
- Registered and orchestrated through Aspire

### Aspire AppHost
- Coordinates services:
  - API
  - Background Worker
  - Redis
  - PostgreSQL
- Enables diagnostics, orchestration, and local development efficiency
